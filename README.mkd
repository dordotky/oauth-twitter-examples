OAuth Examples: Twitter API
===========================

This is a set of PHP based scripts that will perform various tasks with the Twitter API such as posting a status, outputting a Twitter List to a HTML file, Add @username to a list and other common tasks. The set is split into two parts, for single account use and for multiple users.

The documentation for these scripts is mostly inline. They are discussed at [http://dor.ky/code/oauth-examples](http://dor.ky/code/oauth-examples)

Live examples of these scripts can be found at: [http://example.dor.ky/oauth/twitter/](http://example.dor.ky/oauth/twitter/)

You can find more about the licensing of these scripts at [http://dor.ky/licensing](http://dor.ky/licensing) and if you have any questions, please contact me at [scott@dor.ky](mailto:scott@dor.ky)
